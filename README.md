# DetoxDroid

## What it is about

Usually, "Digital Detoxing" apps in Android mean that you opt-in for a contract to not use your phone for the next X minutes. Or that you will not use the app Y for more than Z minutes. These contracts are often reinforced with financial incentives, i.e. if you fail you will have to pay a fee of a few dollars.

This app follows a different, more technical approach (where you can still use other apps complementarily). It does not require you to choose a time and place when you want to "detox", or punish you if you fail. Instead, DetoxDroid aims to enable you to use your phone rather than letting your phone use you. This is to be achieved by stripping away all the attention-grabbing features of your phone.

## Features

### 1. Grayscale your screen
According to former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris, founder of the Center for Humane Technology, going grayscale removes positive reinforcements and dampens compulsive smartphone use.

#### Make Exceptions
While a grayscaled screen has been proven to significantly reduce compulsive smartphone use, there are obvious downsides. For example, you do want to see colors on your screen when you take a photo. Hence, you can allow specific apps to show colors, while the rest of your phone stays gray.

### 2. Automatically enter the "Do Not Disturb" mode
Notifications are the number 1 way for apps to draw our attention. Any app on your phone competes for your attention, and even games will remind you to play them if you have not opened them for a while. Reclaim your time by turning them off with the "Do Not Disturb" mode.

### 3. Opt-out > Opt-in
And rather than needing to opt-in for this mode, you are encouraged to deliberately to pause the app, allowing colors and notifications. If the pause is over, DetoxDroid automatically comes back into life. This makes digital detoxing your new default.
